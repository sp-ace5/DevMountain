For my own simple cipher, I am remapping each letter to a unique symbol. The only way a message could be decoded is with either the key below or by brute forcing the letters.

Encrypted = '+ ](;% !}_)\(%}#)*_'

A = #
B = @
C = !
D = $
E = %
F = ^
G = &
H = *
I = +
J = ?
K = [
L = ]
M = <
N = >
O = (
P = )
Q = {
R = }
S = /
T = \
U = |
V = ;
W = :
X = -
Y = _
Z = ~
