const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = 'Create an overview of the entire project. Determine the requirements and what exactly you want the product to accompolish.'
const design = 'Start making prototypes and begin making the general skeleton of features and UI before coding.'
const implementation = 'Begin coding following outlines made in the design phase until a working version runs correctly.'
const testing = 'Exactly how it sounds, this phase revolves around testing every aspect that a user might experience and fixing any bugs that are found.'
const maintain = 'After release and hearing feedback, you begin to upgrade and implement any new suggestions that could be useful. Making sure customer stays happy.'
